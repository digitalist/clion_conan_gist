Default cmake skeleton for tutorial timer project of conan.io 
Works with clion

after creating/opening the project:
conan install . -s build_type=Debug --install-folder=cmake-build-debug
conan install . -s build_type=Release --install-folder=cmake-build-release

( from https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/integrations/clion.html )

If you have troubles linking with a lot of references to [abi:cxx11], some package (poco for main_libstdcxx.cpp)
requires different lisbstdcxx.

Add a line to: ~/.conan/profiles/default:
    compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
(relates to https://github.com/conan-community/conan-boost/issues/20)
